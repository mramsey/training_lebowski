spec/training_lebowski directory will contain the lebowski code written by the student for the eventual target application project.  The intent is have the student implement a limited subset of the target application so as to lower the learning curve.  We don't want to use the production lebowski project since we don't want to contaminate it with what is written here.  Of course lebowski writtens here could easily be copied to the production lebowski project if desired.
