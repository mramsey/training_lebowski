proxies directory contains folders representing the types of lebowski custom proxies.

In selenium, a proxy is an object that selenium test scripts directly manipulate.  In selenium-client, the tests and the proxies are written in Ruby.  Sproutcore is based on JavaScript.  When a test script manipulates a local proxy object, selenium client libraries pass the commands to the Selenium RC Server.

Selenium RC Server then passes the selenium commands to the "System Under Test" browser as JavaScript commands.

The SUT browser in turn executes the JavaScript.  SUT responses flow in the reverse direction.
